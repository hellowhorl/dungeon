## Summary

You're about to begin the adventure of a thousand steps with just one...`cd`? In our journey,
we use different commands to walk around the world presented to us. In this short excursion,
we'll learn a few of these including:

### For movement

> - `cd`

### To interact
> - `look`
> - `talk`

### To get and receive _things_
> - `inventory`
> - `get`
> - `use`
> - `info`
> - `give`

Each of these will give us abilities that help us negotiate the terrain around us
or...just do _stuff_? Whether that stuff is important to you or not is something
you'll have to figure out. There's a surprising lot to do with the list of commands
above. 

### About this adventure

to be sure, but also _exciting_! What wonders lurk there? What challenges do you have to solve?
What friends and allies will you meet? 

This is the start of your time in `_Venture_`; go forth traveler, and explore!
